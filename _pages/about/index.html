I love geometry and analysis, and have a wide range of interests that combine these two passions. My PhD work was on fourth-order geometric evolution equations. After my PhD, I was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship to be taken at the Otto von Guericke Universitaet Magdeburg, with Prof. Dr. Hans-Christoph Grunau. After this, I started at the University of Wollongong. I have been awarded an ARC Discovery Project, a biennien Peter Schwerdtfeger award, and an AustMS Early Career Teaching Excellence award.</p> <p>Since my PhD work, my interests have expanded to include (the numbers in brackets refer to papers or preprints in my <a href="https://glenw83.github.io/assets/pdf/refs.pdf">list of publications</a>:</p> <ol> <li>Curve and surface diffusion ([14], [22], [44], [45], [49])</li> <li>Families of fourth order flows ([21], [42], [43], [47])</li> <li>Elastic, Willmore and Helfrich ([5], [8], [18], [19], [28], [29], [30], [32], [48], [53])</li> <li>Fire, crystals, and biomembranes ([3], [10], [11], [12], [15], [36], [39], [55], [56])</li> <li>Chen’s conjecture and flow ([4], [7], [40], [46])</li> <li>Flows of arbitrary order ([17], [25], [26], [34], [35])</li> <li>Second-order flows ([1], [13], [50], [51], [52])</li> <li>Ideal flow ([2], [20], [23], [27])</li> <li>Entropy flow [33]</li> <li>Sobolev curvature flow ([31], [38])</li> </ol> <p>Links to my ORCiD, Google Scholar, and other external sites are below.
