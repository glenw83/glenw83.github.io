I'm a mathematician at the University of Wollongong (Australia) working at the interface of geometry and analysis, with a particular focus on the dynamics of geometric evolution equations and higher-order flows. My PhD examined fourth-order geometric evolution equations. After that, I held an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship at Otto von Guericke Universität Magdeburg with Prof. Dr. Hans-Christoph Grunau, continuing work on the dynamics of higher-order geometric flows.

At UOW I pursue questions across geometric analysis and its applications. I'm an [ARC Future Fellow (2026–2030)](https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/FT250100880), developing new perspectives on the Cartan–Hadamard conjecture and on Yau's problem concerning the equivalence of plane curves. I'm also a Chief Investigator on an [ARC Discovery Project (2025–2027)](https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/DP250101080) using mathematics to model the dynamics of bushfires. Previously I was awarded an [ARC Discovery Project](https://researchdata.edu.au/discovery-projects-grant-id-dp150100375/617672) on problems in geometric flows.

My work and teaching have been recognised with the biennial [Peter Schwerdtfeger Award](https://www.humboldtaustralia.org.au/aavhf-award-winners/) and the [AustMS Early Career Teaching Excellence Award](https://austms.org.au/awards-grants/awards/the-teaching-excellence-awards/the-2018-early-career-teaching-excellence-award/). I enjoy clear exposition, collaboration, and finding new connections between curvature, PDE, and real-world phenomena.

I have published specifically on the following topics (the numbers in brackets refer to papers or preprints in my [list of publications](https://glenw83.github.io/assets/pdf/refs.pdf)):

1. Curve and surface diffusion ([14], [22], [44], [45], [49])
2. Families of fourth order flows ([21], [42], [43], [47])
3. Elastic, Willmore and Helfrich ([5], [8], [18], [19], [28], [29], [30], [32], [48], [53])
4. Fire, crystals, and biomembranes ([3], [10], [11], [12], [15], [36], [39], [55], [56])
5. Chen's conjecture and flow ([4], [7], [40], [46])
6. Flows of arbitrary order ([17], [25], [26], [34], [35])
7. Second-order flows ([1], [13], [50], [51], [52])
8. Ideal flow ([2], [20], [23], [27])
9. Entropy flow [33]
10. Sobolev curvature flow ([31], [38])

**Editorial work**. I am on the editorial board for Journal of Evolution Equations ([link](https://link.springer.com/journal/28)) 2025-present, and the Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society ([link](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-australian-mathematical-society)) 2025-present. I have served as guest editor for the MATRIX Annals ([link](https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/book-series/)) for special issues attached to conferences held at MATRIX that I have organised.
