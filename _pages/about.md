I'm a mathematician currently based at the University of Wollongong in Australia.
I love geometry and analysis, and have a wide range of interests that combine these two passions.
My PhD work was on fourth-order geometric evolution equations.
After my PhD, I was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship to be taken at the Otto von Guericke Universitaet Magdeburg, with Prof. Dr. Hans-Christoph Grunau.
After this, I started at the University of Wollongong.
I have been awarded an [ARC Discovery Project](https://researchdata.edu.au/discovery-projects-grant-id-dp150100375/617672), a biennial [Peter Schwerdtfeger award](https://www.humboldtaustralia.org.au/aavhf-award-winners/), and an [AustMS Early Career Teaching Excellence award](https://austms.org.au/awards-grants/awards/the-teaching-excellence-awards/the-2018-early-career-teaching-excellence-award/).

Since my PhD work, my interests have expanded to include (the numbers in brackets refer to papers or preprints in my [list of publications](https://glenw83.github.io/assets/pdf/refs.pdf)):

1. Curve and surface diffusion ([14], [22], [44], [45], [49])
2. Families of fourth order flows ([21], [42], [43], [47])
3. Elastic, Willmore and Helfrich ([5], [8], [18], [19], [28], [29], [30], [32], [48], [53])
4. Fire, crystals, and biomembranes ([3], [10], [11], [12], [15], [36], [39], [55], [56])
5. Chen's conjecture and flow ([4], [7], [40], [46])
6. Flows of arbitrary order ([17], [25], [26], [34], [35])
7. Second-order flows ([1], [13], [50], [51], [52])
8. Ideal flow ([2], [20], [23], [27])
9. Entropy flow [33]
10. Sobolev curvature flow ([31], [38])
